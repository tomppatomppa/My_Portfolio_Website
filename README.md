# My_Portfolio_Website

A portfolio website using HTML, CSS and javascript.

A website to display some of my work and how you can reach me. 
In addition you can find links to my social media accounts.
My plan is to keep updating the website and improving it, while I gather more experience in front-end development.


The website is built in Visual Studio Code v1.58.2.
To run the website you need
- Install node-sass with "npm install node-sass"
- To run the script "npm run sass"


Known propblems
-menu page image not loading in deployed website.
-hover not working on properly on when hovering over the "current" page name.


The website is built based on "Responsive Portfolio Website" series by Traversy Media.
